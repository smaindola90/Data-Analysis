# Sales-Project
The project revolves around the sales data of a computer hardware manufacturing company grappling with sales-related challenges. 

To address these issues, first I integrated MySQL database into PowerBI. 
Then I generated various charts and visualizations to extract valuable insights, conduct customer-type analysis, evaluate profits, and gain a deeper understanding of performance metrics.
